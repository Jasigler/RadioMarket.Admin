# Radiomarket Admin Portal

This is the admin web portal for the RadioMarket project. Its main pupose is to provide a visual representation of microservice health check polling, but will also enable admins to perform tasks that are not available to end users (updating categories, managing users, toggling feature flags, etc.)

As the main Radiomarket project grows, so too will this documentation. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
